==Abstract== 
This SIP defines a new transaction called the &quot;Certificate
Extended Transaction&quot;. 

This extended transaction is used in order to generate
certification certificates which contain digital signatures
referencing their previous chain (parent) transaction. A root-level
certificate will have no previous certificate in the chain. 

==Specifications== 
A certificate contains a title of up to 135 characters, an coin
address of the creator, an optional parent chain certificate hash,
and an optional fee. 

Certificates cost about 6.5 SHC and go down in cost over time. 

A certificate will include the geodetic location of the node which
generated the transaction unless the node is configured otherwise. 

A certificate is signed against the creator's coin address. A
certificate may be flagged to allow derivatives to be created from
itself. 

==Reserved Use== 
The certificate extended transaction is modeled in a manner as to
be compatible with generic digital certificate chains. 

Additional extensions may be provided at a later date which affect
the version, type, and flag variables.
