  Title: Coin Address Alias (Extended Transaction)
  Author: Brian Burrell &lt; support@neo-natura.com &gt;
  Status: Final
  Type: Standard Track
  Created: 2018-12-29</pre>
==Abstract== 
This document introduces the ability to associate a coin address
with a common label. 

==Motivation== 
The Alias Extended Transaction provides the ability to create an
alias between a label (textual string) and a virtual currency coin
address destination. 

==Specification== 
The alias extended transaction is used in order to register and
update public coin address aliases. The alias extended transaction is
composed of three different parts. A string based label with a
maximum of 135 characters, a variable sized coin address, and the
type of coin address being referenced. 

The current proposed implementation includes a single type which
indicates a coin address in it's final string based representation. 

In other words, no internal information about the address is
retained with this type that the coin address is composed of, such as
a public key. This type supports pubkey compressed, witness, bech32,
and dilithium address formats. A new alias is created using the
OP_EXT_ACTIVATE opcode. 

An alias is updated using the OP_EXT_UPDATE opcode. An alias may
be removed with the OP_EXT_REMOVE. Only the original creator may
perform a valid OP_ExT_UPDATE or OP_EXT_REMOVE operation. 

A context will expire after 12 years. Subsequent updates reset
this time-span, and provide a means to retain ownership past the
initial lifetime. 

=== Transaction Fee === 
The transaction coin fee of creating or updating a context can be
derived via the following formula where nHeight is the associated
block height: 

<pre class="western">{
        double base = ((nHeight+1) / 10240) + 1;
        double nRes = 5000 / base * COIN;
        double nDif = 4750 /base * COIN;
        int64 nFee = (int64)(nRes - nDif);
        nFee = MAX(MIN_TX_FEE(iface), nFee); 
        nFee = MIN(MAX_TX_FEE(iface), nFee);
        return (nFee);
}</pre>
==Client Usage== 
The RPC console program will interpret all coin destinations which
are prefixed with a ampersand as an alias. 

For example: shc wallet.send &quot;&quot; @neonatura 0.1
Individual client interfaces may deploy custom methods of supplying
public alias references.
