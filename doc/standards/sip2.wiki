==Abstract== 
This SIP defines a new structure called a "matrix" that
is committed to blocks as an extended transaction. 

==Motivation== 
The matrix extended transaction is used to store a set of numbers
computed with a arbitrary algorithm. 

==Implementation== 
The matrix extended transaction uses the core extended transaction
structure with the addition of the following variables: 

<pre class="western">nType (uint32)
  The type of matrix.
nHeight (uint32)
  An associated block height.
hRef (uint16)
  Reserved.
vData (uint32[3][3])
  The payload contents of the matrix.</pre>
