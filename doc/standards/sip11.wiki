==Abstract== 
This SIP describes a new Offer Extended transaction, and how it is
used in order to transfer funds between two different block-chains. 

==Motivation== 
The purpose of the offer extended transaction is to provide a
method perform a decentralized exchange of coins from one block-chain
to another. This functionality is currently only compatible with the
exchange of SHC coins with the Shioncoin Alternate Colored
Block-Chain coins. 

==Specification== 
The Offer Operational Fee, the cost to publish offer transactions,
is double the minimum transaction fee (0.0002 SHC). Some transactions
may retain a minimum transaction fee, in addition to the offer
operational fee, in order to perform a additional action later on in
the process. An offer extended transaction will expire after 24
minutes. 

A new offer is published on the block-chain using a OP_EXT_NEW
operative. The new offer will include a associated number of SHC
coins, the color hash of the alt-blockchain coins being converted,
the rate of the conversion, and the SHC value range that would be
accepted. An additional "Offer Operation Fee" is also
required. A secondary party may then perform a OP_EXT_ACTIVATE
operative in order to accept the offer. 

The OP_EXT_ACTIVATE extended transaction is sent to a null address
(OP_RETURN), and a separate transaction is created on the colored
alternate block-chain whereby the value of the color coins in sent to
one-self for holding. 

The original party can perform a OP_EXT_GENERATE against an accept
offer in order to complete the exchange. When this occurs, a
transaction is sent on the Shioncoin blockchain with a IF-ELSE
script. This conditional script will send coins to the acceptee if a
pre-determined transaction hash exists on the colored block-chain,
and otherwise will return the coins once the generate offer
transaction has expired. 

The OP_EXT_GENERATE script is composed of the following:
OP_EXT_GENERATE OP_OFFER OP_HASH160 offer_hash OP_2_DROP alt_hash
color_hash OP_CHECKALTPROOF OP_IF dest_addr OP_CHECKSIG OP_ELSE
wait_time OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP return_addr OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ENDIF 
The "offer_hash" is the hash of the OP_EXT_GENERATE's
offer structure, the "alt_hash" is the tx hash on the
colored alt-chain which sends coins from the acceptee to the
originator, the "color_hash" is the hash representing the
color of the alt-chain, the "dest_addr" is the acceptee's
coin address on the Shioncoin block-chain, the "wait_time"
is the time before the generate transaction expires, and the
"return_addr" is the originator's own address. 

The node which originated the acceptee's OP_EXT_ACTIVATE offer
transaction will automatically send the colored alt-coin funds to the
originator, once a OP_EXT_GENERATE is processed, using pre-determined
TX contents. The hash for this TX is included as part of the activate
offer transaction. 

The original sender or the acceptee can cancel the exchange using
a OP_EXT_REMOVE transaction. This can be used by the originator or
acceptee before a OP_EXT_GENERATE transaction is published, or after
a set of transactions has expired due to inaction.
