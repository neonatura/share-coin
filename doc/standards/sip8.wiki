  Title: Ident (Extended Transaction)

==Abstract== 
This SIP defines a new "Ident" extended transaction. The
ident extended transaction is used in order to certify the
originating sender of funds or other auxiliary information. 

==Motivation== 
The ident extended transaction is intended to provide a method for
third-party application to verify the originating identify of funds
being sent. 

In addition, the transaction may be used in order to "stamp"
auxiliary information onto the block-chain. This can include general
information or something more specialized like a geodetic address. 

==Specifications== 
The Certification of a transaction is performed by creating chains
of extended transactions which utilize an "Ident" structure
or a "Certificate" structure (see below). Several other
extended transactions utilize the "Ident" or "Certificate"
extended transaction structure as a base. 

===Ident Structure=== 
The "Ident" extended structure consists of the
following; 

<pre class="western">        {
                /* A geodetic location. */
                shgeo_t geo;
                /* A coin address key. */
                cbuff vAddr;
                /* A mode indicator. */
                unsigned int nType;
        }</pre>
===Usage=== 
A "Certified Funds Transfer" is comprised of a regular
fund send transaction with the addition of a "Ident"
extended transaction. 

The ident extended transaction optionally tracks the geodetic
location of the originating node server, and a payload of textual
information up to 135 characters. 

An ident transaction can specify a geodetic location by using the
format "geo:latitude,longitude" where latitude and
longitude are in decimal degrees format. 

See SIP21 for additional usage of ident extended transactions
utilizing geodetic locations.
