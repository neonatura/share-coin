== Abstract == 
This document introduces the ability to associate a string based
label which references a Shioncoin coin address. 

== Motivation == 
Having a string based alias for a Shioncoin coin address provides
a means to supply a human-digestible label to what is otherwise an
arbitrary code. 

Public entities, such as a store-front, can assign a label to an
address in order to broadcast a receiving address and/or provide
other facilities that can be associated with a coin address. 

== Usage == 
The coin alias functionality is utilized by a shioncoin node by
providing a means to replace references to a coin address with a
alias name prepended by an ampersand (@). 

== Specification == 
The alias extended transaction structure is an extension of the
&quot;Ident&quot; certificate structure. The alias transaction
provides a label of up to 135 characters which references a Shioncoin
coin address. 

The alias is defined as having a &quot;type&quot; which indicates
what type of coin address is being referenced. An coin address alias
can be created, update, and removed. 

Each alias has a life-span of 12 years past when it was created or
the last time it was updated. 

== Examples == 
For example, sending funds to another address: <font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">wallet.send
bank @AliasName 5.5</font>
