==Abstract== 
This SIP describes a pre-compiled bitvector matrix which
encapsulates a set of locations, and how to access it's components.
The Spring Matrix is composed of over one million public
latitude/longitude geodetic locations. These locations are stored as
bitvectors in a set of cells comprising the matrix. All operations
against the matrix consist of removing bitvector values, and
therefore no new information will ever be generated. 

==Motivation== 
The purpose of the Spring Matrix is to provide a low yielding
reward for the identification of a particular geodetic location
currently present in the Spring Matrix. All of the locations in the
Spring Matrix have been predefined. Claiming a location will remove
the bitvector values associated with it's latitude and longitude
permanently from the Spring Matrix. The degree of hardness naturally
increases as a smaller pool of places become available to claim. A
single coin is rewarded for successfully identifying a location in
the Spring Matrix. This value is arbitrarily low in order to avoid
interfering with the economics of the mining ecosystem. 

==Specification== 
The act of claiming a reward is performed by generating a
"identification stamp". The location being claimed has no
relevance to the physical location of the user claiming it, although
additional constraints can be applied (i.e. for VR / geocaching
applications) if desired. 

When a location is "claimed" by an identification stamp
transaction, the underlying bitvector value is removed from the
Spring Matrix. 

The removal of a bitvector will prevent the same location from
being claimed multiple times, and may also prohibit other locations
that rely on aspects of the bitvector from being claimed as well. 

When a identification transaction is received containing a
particular geodetic location, and that geodetic location is currently
present in the Spring Matrix, then the next block will deduct a
single coin from the block reward and generate a supplemental
transaction containing a single coin output to the coin address
specified in the identification transaction.
