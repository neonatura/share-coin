==Abstract== 
This SIP defines a new transaction called a &quot;License&quot;. A
license is derived from an already established certificate. 

Licenses are used in order to indicate a usage of a certificate's
context. For example, a software or audio license may be require to
be attained before the program will run or be played. 

==Specifications== 
A license contains a title of up to 135 characters, an coin
address of the creator, and a parent chain certificate hash. 

A fee must be paid to generate the license if the certificate
being derived specifies one. In addition to any certificate fee, a
0.0001 SHC transaction fee is applied. 

A license will include the geodetic location of the node which
generated the transaction unless the node is configured otherwise. 

A new license is created using the OP_EXT_ACTIVATE extended
transaction operation.
